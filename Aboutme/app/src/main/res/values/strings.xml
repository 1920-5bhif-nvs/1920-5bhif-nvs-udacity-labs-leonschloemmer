    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Leon, I live in Linz and I like to code. In the last six months I\'ve been trying to build a software startup, unfortunately that didn\'t go to well. I acquiered my first customer and eventually had a lot of trouble with them... They didn\'t pay me at all which was quiet concerning, and because of that we almost got into a legal fight... Luckily things turned out okay, because I of course didn\'t do anything wrong! I think this describes me really good. I\'m adventurous, and like to try things out, and like to do things unconventionally.</string>
