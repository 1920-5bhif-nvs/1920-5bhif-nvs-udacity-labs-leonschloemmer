    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Leon, I live in Linz and I like to code.
        \n\n
        In the last six months I\'ve been trying to build a software startup, unfortunately that didn\'t go to well.\n
        I acquiered my first customer and eventually had a lot of trouble with them...\n
        They didn\'t pay me at all which was quiet concerning, and because of that we almost got into a legal fight...\n
        Luckily things turned out okay, because I of course didn\'t do anything wrong!\n
        \n\n
        I think this describes me really good. I\'m adventurous, and like to try things out, and like to do things unconventionally.</string>
